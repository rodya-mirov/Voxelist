The goal, currently, is for this engine to be good enough for another game that I'm working on (currently it has no GitHub project, but it will at some point, and then there will be a link).  I hope that if it's good enough for that game, then it'll be good enough for your game, too.  But the development will be directed almost entirely toward the needs of that game (unless there's an obvious cool feature I can toss in without devoting too much time to it).

As it stands, all the features I currently need are in there.  So while that means I need to work on my other game more, it also means that I'm becoming acutely aware of how efficient this engine is *not*.  So the watchword for now is speed.

I'm not aware of any bugs to speak of, but as they're discovered, they will be cleaned out ahead of any new features.  So here is my feature request list, to myself:

1. Make the Entity system more scalable, so that I can have a large number of mutually interacting Entity objects without slowing the game to a crawl.
2. Make the drawing more efficient, so that I can increase the draw distance.
3. Write useful and helpful documentation for every class.
