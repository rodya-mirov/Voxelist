Voxelist
===

Voxelist is designed to be a generally useful engine for voxel-based, procedurally generated 3D worlds.  More to the point, if you're interested in making one of those types of games, Voxelist should be a "batteries included" framework allowing you to get to the interesting work of designing your game, without having to worry about annoying things like physics or caching or rendering.

To that end, there are a variety of stock classes, some of which need to be extended and some of which are usable as-is.  Each of them has their own separate readme (or will, at some point).  Ideally, the parts of those classes which are specific to your game will be filled in by you, while the natural results of those things, or things common to all games, will be filled in by Voxelist.

Better documentation is forthcoming, but for now, I hope the "minimal working examples" in the several demo projects should give you some idea how to get started.

Enjoy!

ps: I have to put in this last part:
